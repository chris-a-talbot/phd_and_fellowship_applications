# Tips for GRFP applicants

My undergraduate thesis advisor, Marjorie Weber, was an incredible mentor throughout my GRFP application process. She has experience on GRFP review panels and a track record of success, including at least 4 of her PhD students, plus myself, receiving the GRFP under her mentorship. She's even taught a course on applying for the GRFP at the University of Michigan.

So, I've compiled a variety of tips and tricks I learned from her, as well as feedback from various other mentors. Of course, things have changed significantly post-2024, but I hope this can still prove helpful to you as you apply!

## Copy the structure of successful statements 

The GRFP statements are very compact and formulaic. Check out previous successful applicants and identify what each sentence of each section is doing, and aim to mimic it. 

## Make it easy to navigate for reviewers

GRFP reviewers read a ton of essays and have the difficult task of scoring each one relative to the others. The best thing you can do is make your essays easily navigable for them as they look for key rubric items or study design features. You can do this by following the structure they expect (see successful applicants) and by being more direct than you think in your research statement. Reviewers should be able to skim your essay and find you addressing your *questions* ("Q1", "Q2", etc.), *hypotheses* ("I hypothesize that..."), *feasibility* ("This project is feasible because..."), and how you'll *measure success* ("Successful completion of this project will result in..."). Be very, very clear and forward about the intellectual merit and broader impacts - give specifics (e.g. "I will go to XYZ museum via XYZ program to present my work," "I will address a fundamental question to XYZ field, ..."). 

## Quantify success

Measuring success is important both for intellectual merit (how will you know that you've successfully completed an aim or answered a question?) and broader impacts (e.g. if you plan to teach this to high schoolers, how will you measure the impact it has had on students?).

## Create a consistent narrative

If possible, find ways to integrate your personal statement with your research statement. What is your personal connection to the work? How can you make your essays stand together to paint a consistent picture of a scientist who knows what they're doing and why? Aim to create narrative threads that persist throughout all aspects of your application.

## Don't be afraid to take slight risks

For example, I had to decide between excluding information I felt was crucial to proving the feasibility of my research, or excluding a figure. I excluded the figure and made a very dense statement, and no reviewer said a thing about it. My personal statement had a good bit of relatively informal language and didn't make me look like a perfect scientist 100% of the time. In my opinion, it's okay to take calculated risks, even if your statements don't look exactly the same as all the others. However, the risks I took were largely in structure and formality, not in scientific clarity and impact. Make sure you have a clear, simple, executable scientific vision above all else.

## Get lots of eyes on it

I had at least 5 PIs from various fields, 2 full lab groups from different fields, and several friends outside of academia review my essays, and it helped so, so much.

## Make your citations tiny. Like, really, really small

Maximize space by abbreviating citations as much as possible. Mine looked like this:
