# Tips for GRFP applicants

My undergraduate thesis advisor, Marjorie Weber, was an incredible mentor throughout my GRFP application process. She has experience on GRFP review panels and a track record of success, including at least 4 of her PhD students, plus myself, receiving the GRFP under her mentorship. She's even taught a course on applying for the GRFP at the University of Michigan.

So, I've compiled a variety of tips and tricks I learned from her, as well as feedback from various other mentors. Of course, things have changed significantly post-2024, but I hope this can still prove helpful to you as you apply!

## Copy the structure of successful statements 

The GRFP statements are very compact and formulaic. Check out previous successful applicants and identify what each sentence of each section is doing, and aim to mimic it. Note that variation from the typical structure is the norm. However, I will describe the structure I've seen across most successful GRFP winners and honorable mentions in the life sciences below:

### Research Statement

**Section 1**: Introduction/Background (header optional but recommended). Introduce your project in about 1 paragraph. Introduce the gap your research will fill. Typically, research statements have "aims" (3 on average), which are sort of like steps in your research. These should be highlighted in some way. The reviewers are also looking for a strong understanding of the scientific method - developing questions, hypotheses, and approaches to test them. As such, you want to highlight your particular research questions. You may have one in each aim, or have some aims without aims, or have some aims with multiple. Regardless, introduce them here, but you don't need to share your hypothesis.

**Section 2**: Research Plan (header optional but recommended). Typically, this is divided into aims. Detail why each aim is necessary, how you'll complete it (this doesn't need to be the equivalent of your methods section in a paper - it should be clear, feasible, but brief), and how you'll define success for each aim. If your aim has associated questions, restate them, provide a hypothesis, and frame the section as leading up to testing the hypothesis. If some aims rely on other aims, ensure you detail what you'll do if those other aims fail.

**Section 3**: Intellectual Merit (include the header, in bold). This section is meant to detail how your research project contributes to the broader intellectual/academic community. What fundamental, long-standing questions or paradigms are you contributing to? Did you develop methods that will be useful for other scientific questions?

**Section 4**: Broader Impacts (include the header, in bold). This section is meant to detail how your research project will impact broader society. This may be super straightforward - e.g. if you're doing cancer research - or less so, e.g. if you're studying theoretical math. Regardless, you should detail specific plans for science communication and outreach. Will you design a museum exhibit? Teach a class on the subject? Create interactive interfaces? Include undergraduates in the work? 

**Section 5**: References (include the header, in bold). Your references can be super, super abbreviated. All you really need is: "[First name] et al. [year] [abbreviated journal name]". For example, <sup>1</sup>Deraje et al. 2022 _Evol_. Your in-text citations can also be numbers in tiny font superscript. This will save you lots of space.

**Optional additional sections**: 

- Figure (typically, at most 1). Only include a figure if it notably enhances or clarifies your research plan. 

- Feasibility. It's smart to demonstrate that you have considered the feasibility of your plan, especially as it relates to mentorship/support (do you have a PI in mind?) and infrastructure/resources (do you have a department or particular lab in mind?). 

### Personal Statement

**Section 1**: Introduction (no need for a header). This often takes up one to two-thirds of a page. Make a personal connection with your research topic, express why you're passionate, or do whatever else you want in this space.

**Section 2**: Intellectual Merit (include the header, in bold, on its own line). This is your chance to explain why you're qualified to do the research you propose in your research statement, while emphasizing a personal connection to the research and displaying personal growth. This is typically the longest section, at least 1 page but often closer to 1.5 pages.

**Section 3**: Broader Impacts (include the header, in bold, on its own line). This is your chance to explain how you've contributed to broader society from a scientific perspective. Include any teaching experience, science communication, volunteering, or other work that demonstrates community outreach, especially as it relates to science. Continue emphasizing personal connections and growth. This section is often around a page long.

**Optional additional sections**: Feel free to incorporate other headers you think may improve your application. For example, my personal statement included a paragraph under the header "Future Goals." The GRFP is looking for scientists with an interest in continued scientific development (e.g. going into research careers), so find a way to emphasize this in your statement somewhere.

## Make it easy to navigate for reviewers

GRFP reviewers read a ton of essays and have the difficult task of scoring each one relative to the others. The best thing you can do is make your essays easily navigable for them as they look for key rubric items or study design features. You can do this by following the structure they expect (see successful applicants) and by being more direct than you think in your research statement. Reviewers should be able to skim your essay and find you addressing your *questions* ("Q1", "Q2", etc.), *hypotheses* ("I hypothesize that..."), *feasibility* ("This project is feasible because..."), and how you'll *measure success* ("Successful completion of this project will result in..."). Be very, very clear and forward about the intellectual merit and broader impacts - give specifics (e.g. "I will go to XYZ museum via XYZ program to present my work," "I will address a fundamental question to XYZ field, ..."). 

## Quantify success

Measuring success is important both for intellectual merit (how will you know that you've successfully completed an aim or answered a question?) and broader impacts (e.g. if you plan to teach this to high schoolers, how will you measure the impact it has had on students?).

## Create a consistent narrative

If possible, find ways to integrate your personal statement with your research statement. What is your personal connection to the work? How can you make your essays stand together to paint a consistent picture of a scientist who knows what they're doing and why? Aim to create narrative threads that persist throughout all aspects of your application.

## Don't be afraid to take slight risks

For example, I had to decide between excluding information I felt was crucial to proving the feasibility of my research, or excluding a figure. I excluded the figure and made a very dense statement, and no reviewer said a thing about it. My personal statement had a good bit of relatively informal language and didn't make me look like a perfect scientist 100% of the time. In my opinion, it's okay to take calculated risks, even if your statements don't look exactly the same as all the others. However, the risks I took were largely in structure and formality, not in scientific clarity and impact. Make sure you have a clear, simple, executable scientific vision above all else.

## Get lots of eyes on it

I had at least 5 PIs from various fields, 2 full lab groups from different fields, and several friends outside of academia review my essays, and it helped so, so much.

## Make your citations tiny. Like, really, really small

Maximize space by abbreviating citations as much as possible. Mine looked like this:
